Coding Assignment



A retailer is trying to develop a program for archiving their records of business
revenues and expenses. Their data comes from various sources, so they need to
clean it up and then archive it. Can you help them with writing the code?


Step 1: Parsing Data

● You can use the sample data file “data.csv”, attached to this message.
● The file format in CSV;
● The file contains dates, times, transaction types, and transaction amounts
  in dollars; The generic format is as follows:
  mm/dd/yyyy hour:min:sec, type, amount
  All numbers are integers, except the amount which is a double. The
  transaction type is a two-letter string. For example:
    04/12/2017 17:00:00, TS, 132.95
    04/13/2017 17:00:00, TV, -55.20
  Positive transactions are revenues and negative ones are expenses.
● Parse the data and load it into memory.


Step 2: Serialize

● After you parse the data, sort the transactions by date and time;
● Write a function to serialize the sorted information into a binary format of
  your own choosing.
● Note that each transaction type should be written to a different binary file.
  For example, all transactions designated by “TS” should be written to a file
  named “data.ts”, and so on.


Step 3: Deserialize

● The company decides to analyze the data, so we need to deserialize the
  data in the binary files. Write another function to read the binary files of
  Step 2 and merge them into a plain ascii file in CSV format. Please make
  sure that the output data is sorted by date and time.

Step 4: Generate Report

Add a summary of the operations:
● Report the time spent in each of the steps 1, 2, and 3 in milliseconds;
● Report the first and last dates in the data; and
● Report the dates with the highest and lowest profits for each transaction
type.
